## Synopsis

Carrying out a project in R, specifically when the outcome in mind is an
analytic application, entails upfront investment. This is especially
true if the project needs to be reproducible, collaborative, or
frequently change to meet contingency needs. From the outset, the data
scientist has to make decisions, willy-nilly, about how to organise the
project’s scripts, functions, and data in a folder structure that
accommodates present and future needs. Furthermore, the data scientist
has to choose procedures, workflow, and tools to implement and
orchestrate the application’s scripts and functions.

The purpose of this book is twofold. First, to urge data scientists to
choose and stick with a thoughtful framework for building analytic
applications in R. Second, to inform data scientists about a framework
that considers each analytic application as an R package.
